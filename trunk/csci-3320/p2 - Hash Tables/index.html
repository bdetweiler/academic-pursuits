<h2> 
Soundex Hashing
</h2>

For this program you need to write a spelling suggestion list.  
The program will read from a dictionary file, build a hash table for
those words, and check the input.  
If an input word is not in the hash table, it will output the word, and
all entries in the table with the same soundex code.  The output list or
words need to be in alpha order ( case insensititve ).
<p>
There is a reasonably decent dictionary at "/usr/share/dict/words".
As of 11-13-06 the systems is running debian, and they use a
non-standard location of "/usr/share/dict/american-english".
<p>
The program will read from stdin, an optional dictionary may be given with
a "-d" argument.  When parsing the input we will consider any alphanumeric
or hyphen part of a word.  We will ignore any other other input.  For this
I used getline and strtok.

<h3>
Soundex Algorithm
</h3>
<ul>
<li> The first letter of the code is the first letter of the input word.
If the first letter is not a letter, use 'Z'.
<li> The remaining letters of the code are any code that is non-zero, 
and different from the code of the previous letter ( begining with the
second letter ).
</ul>
Soundex codes for this assingment are 1 letter and 4 digits.
But you will want to store the digits as characters so the entire 
code is the same type.
The code contains the first letter of the word (case doesn't matter).
and the the others are mapped to numbers.
The mappings are provided below, in the table.
Any time a code is the same as the code of the previous character, 
it is discarded.  
If I am using 4 digits the default is "Z0000".
<table border=3>
<tr><td> <b>Letters</b> </td><td> <b>Numbers</b> </td></tr>
<tr><td> b,p,f,v </td><td> 1 </td></tr>
<tr><td> c,s,k,g,j,q,x,z </td><td> 2 </td></tr>
<tr><td> d,t </td><td> 3 </td></tr>
<tr><td> l </td><td> 4 </td></tr>
<tr><td> m,n </td><td> 5 </td></tr>
<tr><td> r </td><td> 6 </td></tr>
<tr><td> All Others </td><td> 0 </td></tr>
