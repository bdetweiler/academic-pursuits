<h2> Graphs </h2>

This program needs to compute the shortest path for a graph.  
I would recommend using Dijkstra's for this problem.  
<p>
This program needs to read the input from a file.  The file is format is 
a path to compute and the set of edges.  Each edges is in the form of 
source node, destination node, and distance.  For this problem the
graphs are not directed, and node names may be contigious non-whitespace
symbols.
<p>
The output needs to give the distance and the path from source the
destination.

<a href=prog.out>Here are some sample runs</a><br>
<p>
This program is due December 6th.<br>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li> write code to represent a graph
<li> solve for a common graph
</ul>
