<h2> Graphs </h2>

This program needs to compute the shortest path, and minimum spanning
tree for a graph.  I would recommend using Dijkstra's for the shortest
path, and Prim's for the minimum spanning tree.  Part of this problem is
choosing a good representation of the graph for the problem you are
solving.
<p>
This program needs to read the input from stdin.  The input is defined
as the path to compute and the edges.  Each edges is defined as the the
source node, destination node, and distance.  For this problem the
graphs are not directed, and edge names may be contigious non-whitespace
symbols ( I used a hash table to go from symbol to index, feel free to
use a list or some other type, just account for it in your analysis ).
<p>
In order to accomplish this problem, I used several datatypes.  
Some of the containers I used were vector and Dheap.
I also defined Graph, Vertex, Edge, Table, and Row.  
This does not mean yours must have these, they are just suggestions.
<p>
Your program only needs to output the minimum spanning tree, 
shortest path.
