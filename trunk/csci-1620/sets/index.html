<h2> 
Linked Lists
</h2> 
This program is a set problem.  You need to read in two sets of data, and
display the union, intersection, and difference of the two sets.  You are
going to store the sets in linked lists.
<p>
The definition of a set for this problem is : ordered with no duplicate values.
<p>
I have provided the main program for you.  Note that I am having you
define some operators on the List type.
<p>
<a href=sets.cpp>The main program</a> do NOT modify this code.<br>
<a href=output.txt>here is a sample run from mine</a><br>

<br>Here are the <a href="honors.html">honors requirements.</a>
<p>
This program is worth 150 points.<br>
It is due on November 20th/21st.<br>
<br>

<h2>The Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>write a linked list
<!--<li>write templated code-->
<li>solve a simple math problem
<li>review operator overload
</ul>
