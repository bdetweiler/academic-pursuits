<h2> Heaps </h2>

This program will simulate a process queue.  The idea is the program will
run some programs giving time slices based on the priority.

<h3> the input file </h3>
The process entries will be in a file, one per line. The data is the start
time, priority level, total time to run, and process name.  All start
times will be in order and unique.  The process name may be multiple
tokens.
<br>
<a href="file.data">Here is a sample input file</a><br>

<h3> the process </h3>
Each process is defined by the priority level, the number of time 
units until completion, and the name/string for the process.  
When you insert each process into the heap, just add the priority 
level to the time is is placed in the heap to generate an 
effective priority ( effective priority = priority + insert time ).  
The heap is sorted by the effective priority.  
The input will be in order by start time, and the start times will be
unique ( this makes input easier ).

<h3> the heap </h3>
Your heap needs to be a D-Heap.  I will recommend that you try an int
heap first, then turn it into a heap of type "Process", or template it.

<h3> the main program </h3>
You will handle the first argument as your input file.  
This program will follow a form of having a loop for each time unit.  
You will need to read in a process, if the start time has arrived place 
the process in the heap, then read in the next process.  Be sure to test 
for fail and/or eof on your input stream.  If the heap is not empty, get a 
process from it, and run it and output the name, if the process is not 
done place it back on the heap, don't forget to update the effective 
priority level to reflect the time.
<p>
I want your ouput to show the time, any new inserts, 
what process if any is running in that time interval, 
and if it finished.  I want only one line per time unit.

<a href="output.txt">Here is a sample run from my program</a> 
based on the earlier input file<br>

<h3> program arguments </h3>
Pass the input filename as the first argument, 
the number of time units to run as the second, 
and the d-value as the third ( ex: sched ./file.data 100 2 ).

<p>
This program is due Septmber 18th.<br>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li> write a D-Heap
<li> solve a heap ( priority queue ) problem
<li> provide a basic analysis
</ul>
