<h2> 
Huffman encoding and decoding
</h2>

The book has the full algorithm and an example starting on page 395.
Huffman is a fairly standard compression algorithm, and it is still 
commonly used.
<p>
In order to do this you need a very simple tree.  The nodes need a char
and a number of occurances ( I used an unsigned short in mine ).  The
tree does not need any of the standard BST methods, but you will need to
be able to create a tree from two existing trees.  All data is stored in
the leaf nodes, frequency information is stored in every node in the tree.

<h3>
Huffman tree algorithm
</h3>
Place each char/frequency pair in a group of trees.  As long as there
are more than one tree left, combine the two smallest ( by frequency )
trees, the frequency of the new tree is the sum of the combined two.
The tree you are left with is the huffman tree.

<p>
The standard algorithm states that you use a priority queue ( aka
heap ) to store the trees.  Use a heap of tree pointers instead, 
it makes combining the trees much easier, and since they are pointers
you don't have to copy any tree data.  Any other structure would be less
efficient.

<h3> Encoding </h3>

This is a two pass problem.  The first pass is to collect the letter
frequencies.  You need to use that information to create the Huffman
tree ( I also created a map to go from char to Huffman code ).  Note
that char values range from -128 to 127.  I stored the data as unsigned
chars to solve for this problem, then the range is 0 to 255.
<p>
Open the output file and write the frequency table to it.  
Open the input file, read characters from it, get the codes, and write
the encoding into the output file.

<h3> Decoding </h3>

This can be done in one pass.  Open the encoded file and read the
frequency data out of it.  Create the Huffman tree base on that
information ( The total number of encoded bytes is the frequency at the
root of the huffman tree. ).  Read data out of the file and search the
tree to find the correct char to decode ( a 0 bit means go left, 1 go
right ).  This gets tricky since you read in 8 bit blocks, but the codes
can be shorter or longer than that and there are no seperators.

<h3> Huffman codes to binary data  </h3>

Since they are arbitrary in length, Huffman codes can be difficult to
represent.  The string datatype has major advantages, the length can 
be changed, characters can be appended to them, or removed from them at
either end.
<p>
While you will probably use strings to represent the codes, you are not going
to write a string of ones and zeros to the file.  That would defeat the point
of the program, which is file compression.  You will need to convert from a
string of length 8 to a char value which can written to the file, and do there
reverse process as well.

<h3> Binary file I/O </h3>

You are going to need to do binary file I/O for this assignment.  When
doing binary file input you can read and write entire blocks of data in
one command, or use get and put.  This also gives you some flexibility
as far as what type of data is in the file.  Some operations do not make
sense with binary data, getline would be a good example.

<pre><code>
ifstream fin ( in.c_str(), ios::binary );
// read in the entire frequency array 
unum freq[256];
fin.read ( (char*)(freq), sizeof(freq) );
// read the remaining characters until end of file
while( fin.get(ch) )
{
        ;// do your thing here
}
fin.close();
</pre></code>

Note that write is the opposite of read.

<h3> Program arguments </h3>
Your program must use the following command line arguments.  They can be
input in any order.
<ul>
<li> -i input_file  : required
<li> -o output_file : required
<li> -e  : turn on encoding mode ( default )
<li> -d  : turn on decoding mode
<li> -v  : verbose mode, displays the huffman tree
</ul>

<h3> Source code </h3>
<a href="start.sh">Here is a shell archive</a>, it contains a Makefile, 
test script, sample input, some helper functions, and the driver.  You
are not required to use it, but it should be helpful as a framework.

<br>
<a href="sample.run">Here is a sample run from mine</a><br>

<h3> Programming tip </h3>
Start by generating the huffman tree based on the input.  If you can't
do that, the rest of it won't work anyway.  Then work on
encoding and decoding the actual data.

<p>
This program is due October 18th.<br>
You are required to turn in all source files needed to compile, 
a Makefile, and a short analysis paper.

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li> use non search trees in an algorithm
<li> properly and consistantly generate the dynamic huffman tree 
<li> perform huffman encoding and decoding
<li> use indirect storage 
<li> provide a basic analysis
</ul>
