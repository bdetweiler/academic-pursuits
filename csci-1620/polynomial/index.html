<h2> Polynomials </h2>
You need to create a polynomial data type.  
You need to be able to add, subtract, and multiply your polynomials.  
In addition you will need to be able to output them, and add terms to them.
<p>
Keep in mind that polynomials are a collection of terms, which include a 
coefficient, variable, and exponent.  The number of terms must be dynamic.
To make the problem easier, the variable will always be 'x'.

<a href="sample.txt">Here are some sample runs from mine</a><br>
<a href="main.cpp">Here is the main program</a><br>
NOTE: Do not modify the main program.  In order to retrieve the code use
wget ( give the url as the argument ).
<p>
When outputting the polynomials, all like terms should be combined, and
the terms need to be in order based on exponent.
<p>
This program is due on October 2nd/3rd.<br>
