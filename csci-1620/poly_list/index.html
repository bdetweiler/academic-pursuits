<h2> Polynomials and Linked Lists </h2>

For this program you are going to re-impliment the polynomial program
using a linked list.
<p>
All requirements are indentical to the original assignment.
<p>
<a href="main.cpp">Here is the main program</a><br>
NOTE: Do not modify the main program.
<p>
NOTE: Your Term class may not declare Poly as a friend for this
assignment.  You do not need any get or set methods in Term either, 
if you find that you want to use one, that means you need to write 
a Term operator to do the work. 
( This is because too many people are avoiding writing the 
operators, which was the point of that assignment, and the one before
it too. )
<p>
This program is due on October 25th/26th.<br>
<p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>use and write operator overload
<li>create classes
<li>use the classes in a program
<li>use and write node based memory allocation
</ul>
