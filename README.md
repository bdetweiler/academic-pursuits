Code used for projects like Elevator Saga, Project Euler, ACM Programming Contests, etc.

All of my programming assignments from undergrad are in here as well, for good examples on how not to write C++. 

Languages include C, C++, Java, JavaScript (for Elevator Saga), PHP, and Erlang (for Project Euler).
